In the past year I have been lucky to be part of the training program we started in our San Francisco office. As we were starting out fresh on this initiative, it was exciting and very much like a greenfield technology project. 
When I got involved, there were a handful of fresh college graduates starting their foray into consulting and technology all at the same time. Everything from being a ThoughtWorker, consulting at a client team, working with a mix of old and new technologies and finding firm footing in a new city, posed challenges to them. On top of this we asked a little more of them, making themselves available for 4 hours every fortnight to be able to attend an in-class training. This meant that they had to make themselves billable for 80 hours outside of the friday afternoons they were in training.(A tough ask, since at every client there are things happening all the time and being away during working hours could mean a lot.)


When we started we did not have a training program per se- what we had was a rough plan and a couple of introductory sessions lined up. Much worked remained in figuring out what is required to support the consultants on ground - both experienced and fresh. Experienced consultants - demanded that certain basic technology skills should be taught so that it makes the new consultants more comfortable in their jobs. Fresh consultants knew they were missing something - sometimes exactly what it was, sometimes just the feeling of being not ready enough. My job was to balance some of this while delivering value within the constraints.

Initially it was quite a lot of work around visiting projects, understanding what is being built, what are the client constraints and what the client environment feels like. Much of what I did during those days was collecting a lot of these details and find the missing pieces that needed to be supported by training.

* How we designed the training program - one course/session at a time.

Once a certain training course/session was decided, it was upon us(JK joined me shortly after we started this program), to figure out who(if not one of us) could conduct this session. In finding the right facilitator we were trying to balance - material, authority of the presenter in that area, availability, richness of the interaction with the program students - with different weightings on these parameters every time. Another parameter that would throw off our planning was the opportunity of time for a certain session.
