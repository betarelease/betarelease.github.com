title: Installing DWA-125 Dlink adapter on Ubuntu - over and over again

Looks like they want to make it really hard to install and use USB
wireless adapters on Ubuntu. With the newest version 11.10 of Ubuntu, I
had to download an even newer version of Dlink driver. 

One of the issues I faced while building the driver : Multiple versions
of linux kernel. 

If you have multiple versions of the linux kernel installed - and do not
know which version is being booted into - look at your grub
configuration. Check for the latest versions of the kernel and install
it. Once this kernel version is installed, boot your Ubuntu into this
kernel and delete all the older kernel versions. The reason for doing
this is that different kernel versions have different compatibilities
for the modules you would be installing on them. Also some libraries are
compiled into the kernel and conflict with the compile when you run a
'make' or 'make install'.

Once you have a clean kernel, build the latest Dlink driver with this
kernel. 

After building the binaries run 'modprobe rt5470sta'. Ensure that you
have already blacklisted other drivers from loading 'rt2870sta,
rt3070sta'.

Once this is installed and loaded, add it to init.d.
