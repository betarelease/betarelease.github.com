If you are using iTunes to play your music be careful when adding music to the library. iTunes tries to be smart and by default it makes a copy of the music you have as well as tries to organise it the way it likes. So if you do not like your music organised by artist/album and so on it will render your music unsearchable. (This is true for me since I do not organise my music by the artist album and such.)

To save the whole lot of mess it creates set the following in your iTunes preferences

This way iTunes will make a list of songs but not process them the way it likes. You can have your own organisation of music and save a lot of trouble for yourself.
