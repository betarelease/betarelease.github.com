title: Why should you be a trainer?
tags: [trainer, speaking, prepare, thoughtworks university, sessions]

After being thoroughly impressed by the <a href="">training</a> that I
received when I joined ThoughtWorks I was driven to become a trainer
myself. I did that in 2008 (yes itâ€™s already been that long) and am a
different person professionally since then.

I am documenting my experiences for future reference as a mulitpost on
Training. As I continue posting the topics on the list here will become
active. Maybe as you read it will excite you to be a trainer too.
