On the last day I had just enough time to listen to
<a href="http://www.8thlight.com/main/bio?sub_action=eric">Eric
Smith</a> and
<a href="http://www.8thlight.com/main/bio?sub_action=eric_meyer">Eric
Meyer</a> from <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/">8th light</a> where
they talked about TDD with IPhone. \
What was interesting was even while working with this difficult
technology (Objective C is not hard but Xcode is nothing but cryptic -
XIB files really?) they were able to build iPhone apps without giving up
of basic principles of TDD.

They demonstrated their struggle before any tools were available for
Unit testing with iPhone.\
Couple of tools they mentioned were

\1. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/">Google
Toolbox for the Mac</a>

\2. <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/unittest.html">OCUnit</a>

Something to make life less miserable when building better applications
with iPhone.
