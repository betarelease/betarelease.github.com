I had almost forgotten about [Tab Slideshow](http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-slideshow/)
for Firefox but an appropriate application of it jogged my memory. We
wanted to show a few build reports on the dashboard and also wanted them
to be big and visible. Also the reports do not change as rapidly as the
build and can afford to be little delayed (since mostly we are showing
long running build results). So we just opened up those reports in a tab
each and started ‘Tab Slideshow’. Worked like a charm. We now have the
simplest dashboard.

Note: [Tab Slideshow for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loepeenhjndiclafjgoackjblfhonogb)
does not seem to refresh the tabs where as the Firefox version does what
is expected.
