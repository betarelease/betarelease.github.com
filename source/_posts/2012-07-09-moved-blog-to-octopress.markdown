 I am in the process of moving the blog from my jekyll based site to [octopress](http://github.com/octopress.git)


You may notice :

* Posts show up clearer and nicer - because of octopress font selection
* you will see my addition of tag cloud to octopress - so tags will show
* archives - a list of archives arranged as an index page

What does not yet work :

* Tags are not aligned on the page
* Disqus comments are missing - thanks to discuss your comments are safe. They just need to be linked correctly
* RSS feed is missing
* My color scheme is missing - so does not reflect the author's personality ;)


Hope you will bear with me while I make things easier for me to post and bring a more pleasant reading experience for  you.

Thank you !!!
