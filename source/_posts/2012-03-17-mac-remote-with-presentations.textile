When preparing for a presentation recently I was looking at various presentation tools at my disposal. 

Purchasing one of those mouse like remotes was an option. I already had a magic mouse that could do the job. I also had a mac remote with keys that indicated forward/reverse. But by default it cannot be used as a mouse like remote for forward/reverse.

I stumbled upon "iRedlite":http://www.filewell.com/iRedLite/ . Just the tool I was looking for to use the slick mac remote for my presentation.

As an added bonus iRedlite is programmable to achieve different functionality based on the context of the application. Also that application context can be changed using the remote.

Thank you "tin:b":http://tinbert.com/ for such applications. They have many more - check them out.
