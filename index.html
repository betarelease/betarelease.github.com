  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you have been following this blog, you may have been curious what I have been upto recently. Few weeks ago we(Pengchao Wang and I ) go selected to speak at the aws re:invent 2013 conference to speak about our tool eb_deployer.</p>

<p>Here is a little bit of insight on what it is about and why we wrote it.</p>

<h2>So you want to use the cloud</h2>

<p>So like everyone else wanted to put our software on the cloud and stop maintaining a shrinkwrap version. Among other things we want to develop many features - fast and have them enhanced as we go. We started building or transforming Mingle to be a SaaS but slowly. When we wanted to add new services that did not belong in Mingle we build them as separate services. This is how Cycle Time Analytics and Single Sign On is built for Mingle. While putting these services on the &#8216;cloud&#8217; we started mending our ways to follow the amazon way. The first attempt along that way was to use CloudFormation and we chose that because it gave us ultimate flexibility and control.</p>

<h2>But do not want to do any work</h2>

<p>But CloudFormation meant a bit of work to maintain the definitions and be meticulous about turning each and every knob and getting it right. We did not want to do any work for the new services we were building since we did not have the constraints of Mingle.</p>

<h2>You should think of Elastic Beanstalk</h2>

<p>On closer look we found Elastic Beanstalk - a technology meant especially for our needs - minimum work maximum benefit. We started building and deploying to Elastic Beanstalk stacks(as they are called) and were amazed with how much we could get accomplished with little effort. Elastic Beanstalk gave us basic technology stack along with autoscaling, basic monitoring and logging all in the bundle. But we wanted to do more with it - think continuous delivery.</p>

<h2>And use EbDeployer</h2>

<p>Elastic Beanstalk allowed us to worry less about deployments more about our code. When we started deploying regularly we found Elastic Beanstalk wanting in some areas. So Pengchao Wang started building now what we call EbDeployer - a tool for automated blue-green deployments for your continuous delivery cycle.</p>

<p>EbDeployer as it is built relieves you from the pain of writing any Elastic Beanstalk api code. All you need to do is package your application, define some basic parameters and deploy(or eb_deploy). You are done!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The ThoughtMakers meetup was kicked off last week in the San Francisco office. This was the first meeting of enthusiasts sharing ideas and projects that bridged the gap between the real and virtual world.</p>

<h2>Skillset and interests</h2>

<p>We started this group since there was plenty of interest in understanding the hardware world and we had a number of people who already were into tinkering/breaking and building electronic toys. So we thought putting some energy behind it would present another way of people to interact and share.</p>

<p>A quick survey of the room revealed that a number of them had dabbled in building something hardware in their past - school days, self learnings, job experience. The room was largely split between enthusiasts wanting to build/have built remote controlled toys and the other half eager to solder everything. A number of enthusiasts were in this group to find out if they could learn and find someone to mentor them initially to jump the self-learning curve.</p>

<h2>Showcasing what we had already</h2>

<p>Antonio presented his vision of the internet of things. He stressed on why it is now easily possible to venture into the hardware world - what with easy access to cheap hardware - arduino, raspberrypi and such. He also focused on showcasing how this tinkering could lead to useful solutions for the businesses.</p>

<p>Pete Hodgson showcased his awesome build light- built with an arduino board and strip of multicolor LEDs all wired up inside a cheap IKEA table lamp.</p>

<p>I showed off Ian&#8217;s Mingle card wall reader built for RFID cards that interfaces with Mingle on the web, and the leap motion control we prototyped for using Mingle with gestures.</p>

<h2>What is happening next and why you should join?</h2>

<p>Everyone participating is excited to build something soon. So we will be working on presenting our ideas and finding people to pair with/get support from.</p>

<p>There are also some lightning talks planned - some around self learning these skills and some around the cool projects we will be building.</p>

<p>Also watch out for some guest speakers with some expertise and hands on experience in the field of building hardware.</p>

<p>If you have a project in mind do come along and share.</p>

<p>It happens every other Wednesday from 6pm to 8pm. Next one is scheduled for Oct 30th.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At our San Francisco office we have been working on building mobile development capabilities recently. Here is a little glimpse into what we did to make it work.</p>

<p>The plan was to build enough initial capability so that we could bring everyone at a collaborative workshop and take their skills to the next level. This program started by a facilitated learning around designing applications for the mobile. We focused on Android platform.</p>

<h2>Incorporating feedback and setup in advance</h2>

<p>One of the feedback items in the past Android Intensive Retrospective was the time and energy wasted in setup. We had chosen a single app for the purpose of the workshop but everyone had to jump through the hoops of having to set it up and invent the wheel again for their own machine. To speed this process James Spargo and Kris worked on creating a VM that would have everything setup and ready to go. They spent a weekend doing that. Having this setup helped immensely because everyone was ready to write code right away.</p>

<p><em>Key: Ensure better preparation with setup of environments.</em></p>

<h2>Smaller lessons, quicker turnaround, more collaboration</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/code_showcase.jpg" width="450" height="700"></p>

<p>Having everything setup had us started on the right foot. Kris also consciously chose stories that would be implemented in a short time so that we would have more time to talk about the nuances and learn more. Since the code was ready to deploy making small changes and iteratively see it work was a satisfying experience to the developers. We also did more frequent/more showcases of code as we observed that there were multiple approaches being implemented. At one point of time it was a competition, where everyone wanted the best implementation to be shown and used. This debate of ideas kept the mood light and allowed for healthy critique of implementation. Also since it was being done iteratively and committed to the code base everytime we would be able to see/trace the evolution of the implementation.</p>

<p><em>Key: Small, achievable, sharable goals.</em></p>

<h2>Concepts we learnt and implemented</h2>

<ul>
<li>Adding the action bar to an application</li>
<li>Adding navigation in the action bar - edit, search etc.</li>
<li>Adding the back button to the action bar</li>
<li>Adding the maps and making your application location aware.</li>
<li>Deployment to an android device - with hockeyapp</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Key: Focus on what is important and do not be too ambitious.</em></p>

<h2>Learnings from the Android Intensive</h2>

<p>We had a flow going for the android intensive workshops. Some of the things we did that worked for such a workshop are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frequent code sharing and showcase</li>
<li>Planning the lessons ahead of time - including a sample code base</li>
<li>Having a well configured environment(in this case a VM) - was immensely helpful in ensuring that everyone can get started fast.</li>
<li>Narrower focus allowed for rapid/more learning</li>
<li>We lost a few members since the last workshop - Having a smaller team helped. Need to ensure that more people can remain committed to such efforts.</li>
<li>Having a dedicated trainer(thanks Kris Gonzalez) - was of immense value - in terms of experience, prep of workshops and getting the right lessons across.</li>
<li>Having atleast one point person on each team(special thanks James Spargo) - ensured coordination and collaboration issues became a shared responsibility.</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Key: Teams with dedication with the right facilitation can make these kinds of programs successful.</em></p>

<p>Acknowledgement: This workshop and the program would not have been this awesome without Kris Gonzalez and James Spargo.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At our San Francisco office we have been working on building mobile development capabilities recently. Here is a little glimpse into what we did to make it work.</p>

<p>The plan was to build enough initial capability so that we could bring everyone at a collaborative workshop and take their skills to the next level. This program started by a facilitated learning around designing applications for the mobile. We focused on Android platform.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Android and self-learning</h2>

<p>At the start of the learning session we gathered the developers and split them into teams to allow for collaboration based on colocation and interest. Once the teams were setup they worked on figuring out what they would like to build during this learning experience. Since the focus was learning the ability to deliver business driven value was allowed to be compromised when it made sense.</p>

<p>Most of the development team was fairly inexperienced with this technology so we involved Kris to get us started. He helped us get started with a video explaining us how the ecosystem differs from a basic java stack and how to use the IDE and build sytem. Once we all got a hang of it, the teams were on their own course of trying to build something and test it with prevalent testing tools.</p>

<p>One of the teams figured out how to use Robolectric for unit tests. Another group figured out how to use calabash tests and build this on TravisCI. While the teams were addressing different domains, their basic problems were similar viz. making requests, receiving data, displaying it efficiently. Once the teams were more comfortable breaking and building their apps, we started planning for a collaborative workshop.</p>

<p><em>Key: Build teams to facilitate self-learning.</em></p>

<h2>Planning for the training</h2>

<p>We chalked out a weekend where we were able to get all the developers and trainers in the same location for a workshop. Apart from how long the training was we wanted to ensure that whatever we covered applied to all the teams and the applications that they were building. The initial versions of the applications were looked at, and assessed to understand testability, domain and maturity.
Given the structure of the program and the heavy collaboration we wanted to ensure - we wanted tackle a well defined set of stories that would be small. Also, that the stories needed to cover enough ground into the Android technology space.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/piggy.jpeg" width="450" height="700"></p>

<p><em>Key: Focus on short set of cohesive stories.</em></p>

<h2>Planning the stories</h2>

<p>Another goal was to ensure that the teams met each other and were able to share skills across the different experience levels, we decided to pick one application that everyone would work on. We picked that application and setup the teams to have the code downloaded and ready to be shared. Using the same application gave us a clear direction to write stories for the workshop and also we could ensure consistency of learning across teams.</p>

<h2>Setup of the workshop and getting started</h2>

<p>When we began we started with a quick review of the plan for the day. We allowed everyone to get the smae codebase on their machines and ensure that all of that works as expected on all of them. Once they all had the same code we paired people off in such a way that we had enough coverage within each pair about the knowledge of the shared code. Thus ensuring that each pair could get a quick headstart.</p>

<p><em>Key: Start with a short icebreaker to ensure safe environment.</em></p>

<h2>Narrowing the scope of the exercise</h2>

<p>The aspirations for the workshop were to learn building applications with location services, accelerometer, cross app integration and such. But after the review of the state of the applications it was realized that the application development process needed to focus more on the basics -like building the interfaces more cleanly, allowing for testing, allowing for change and refactoring and improving performance of the application. So a smaller more achievable set of stories were created that would address the above goals. The original aspirations - some of them can be learnt by looking at examples and some of them were postponed for a later workshop.</p>

<p><em>Key: Plan for more than the time allocated, but expect to finish less and adapt.</em></p>

<h2>Development practices that help during a workshop</h2>

<p>The workshop trainers and teams agreed on a few ground rules during the training.</p>

<ul>
<li>   Progressively work on adding features to the stories being built</li>
<li>   Pair during development and share the same code</li>
<li>   Present the code at every recess and discuss and critique code</li>
<li>   Understand the alternatives during each show and tell</li>
<li>   Take the best parts/patterns and share them as baseline for the next exercise</li>
<li>   After every recess - share code and switch pairs - to allow sharing experience</li>
<li>   No developer left behind - Help each other setup machines, checkin code, understand concepts and move on.</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="left" src="/images/android_pairing.jpeg" width="450" height="700"></p>

<p><em>Key: Do frequent checks to ensure that everyone is engaged and keep pace of the session.</em></p>

<h2>Uncovering hard lessons.</h2>

<p>The intent of this workshop was to bring all the teams together and collaborate. While doing so we wanted to understand some basic concepts in depth. Ensuring people collaborate on the same project, sharing code periodically and developing a feature in depth worked for us well. We were not able to cover as much as we had planned but were able to discover patterns, discuss them and apply them to our applications. Having the focus ensured the richness of learning. We were able to build complete UI, make it testable and learn how to tune its performance. We were able to learn how Android behaves and communicates with a service.
Learning about the mobile experience - especially where we learnt how to allow the user to scroll through a bunch of listings with images without giving a feel of &#8216;the app is still loading as it is scrolled&#8217; - was what we achieved by the end of the workshop.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/android_showcase.jpeg" width="450" height="700"></p>

<p>Concepts we learnt:</p>

<ul>
<li>   The Android toolkit, Junit and Robolectric are not always in sync. So beware of version compatibilities between these. We fixed the incompatibilities by using Android SDK platform version 17.</li>
<li>   Robolectric does some clever things to allow you to be able to mock the context for Android objects - so that you can test them.</li>
<li>   Load images and other streams of data using AsyncTask so that the app loads immediately</li>
<li>   Use an Adapter to delegate the tasks of loading all the listing data. This allows you to also change the implementation, point to a different endpoint, tune it for performance without changing how the UI has been laid out.</li>
<li>   The ViewHolder allows separation between domain objects and how they are wired to the data. The Adapter can delegate such tasks to the ViewHolder thus allowing to change the view as and when the experience needs to change it.</li>
</ul>


<p>After the last session of pairing we were able to discuss and summarize what we learnt through a retrospective. Although we all agreed that we did not get everything done, the overall workshop was helpful in bringing everyone together and learning a few concepts in detail.</p>

<p><em>Key: Working on some key concepts indepth helped the overall focus of the workshop.</em></p>

<p>Acknowledgement: This workshop and the program would not have been this awesome without Kris Gonzalez and Michael Wongwaisayawan</p>

<p>Announcing SiriMingle - a tool to interact with Mingle using SiriProxy. Bringing the power of Siri voice control to modify cards, get status and ask questions about the project.</p>

<p>It can be downloaded from <a href="http://github.com/betarelease/sirimingle.git">sirimingle</a> and used with SiriProxy.</p>

<p>SiriProxy is a proxy written in ruby 1.9 to allow people to use the power of Siri to perform useful tasks. Setting up SiriProxy was not trivial before. Over time and on 12.04 it can be more easily done.</p>

<p>Here is how:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install Ubuntu 12.04 on your virtualbox(virtual box link), or natively on your desktop/macpro.(For dualbooting on macpro follow the instructions : )
On virtualbox the following setting needs to be configured to ensure that the VM running Ubuntu gets a native IP address on the host network.</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="left" src="/images/vm_config.png" width="300" height="500"></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Install git, ruby et al.. (Assuming that you already know this)</p></li>
<li><p>Download the <a href="http://github.com/betarelease/SiriProxy.git/install_deps.sh">install_deps.sh</a> script to get you started. It is recommended that you download the whole project.
Run the script. This script should install all dependencies required for dnsmasq. dnsmasq is a tool that allows you to perform dns masquerading on any network. After running this script you should have the following : dnsmasq, rvm and ruby 1.9.3 installed.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.techjawa.com/2012/01/31/guide-setup-working-siriproxy-three-little-pigs/">Guide: Setup Working SiriProxy</a> is a great guide to setting SiriProxy correctly. You can choose to ignore setting up the Three Little Pigs server.
Follow the instructions closely to setup Ubuntu 12.04 with dnsmasq and Siriproxy.</p>

<p>If everything has gone well so far you should see</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>&quot;Starting server on port 443&quot;</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>This verifies that the dnsmasq is setup correctly and that Siriproxy can be run on your machine.</p>

<p>Now generate a certificate</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>siriproxy gencerts # generates certificates in .siriproxy folder</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>Email this certificate and install it on your phone by opening the email and opening the attachment.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/sirimingle_cert.png" width="300" height="500">
<img class="right" src="/images/dns_entry.png" width="300" height="500"></p>

<p>Once the cert is installed change the dns settings for the network and add the IP address of your Ubuntu machine before the other DNS server entry.</p>

<p>Now your phone is ready to talk to your Siriproxy server.</p>

<p>Restart your SiriProxy server by</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>rvmsudo siriproxy server</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>Invoke Siri on your phone: You should see the interaction logs in your terminal indicating that infact Siri is connecting to your SiriProxy via your dnsmasq.</p>

<p>Once you have SiriProxy setup change the ~/.siriproxy/config.yml to add your mingle hostname and credentials. This will allow SiriProxy to interact with the Mingle API.</p>

<p>Restart SiriProxy by doing the following:</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>rake install

siriproxy bundle #this should install the dependencies including the siriproxy-sirimingle plugin.

rvmsudo siriproxy server</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>Once the server is started you should be able to talk to SiriMingle.</p>

<p>Let the Siri be with you.</p>
</div>

      <p class="meta">








  


<time datetime="2012-09-10T09:16:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 10<span>th</span>, 2012</time></p>
      <p class="tags">osx, linux, dualboot, boot, REFIt, EFI, grub, partition, bootcamp</p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Installing Ubuntu on Macpro turned out to be little trickier than I would have liked it to be. For starters OSX Lion does not detect the Ubuntu ISO disc as bootable or something that bootcamp can load an OS from. There are tricks on the web that allow you to get around that.</p>

<p>I am listing a few quirks that I came across while getting all this to work.</p>

<p>The Challenge: Install Ubuntu on a MacPro that is running OSX Lion and make it so that it can dualboot to ubuntu.</p>

<ul>
<li>Install REFit</li>
</ul>


<p>Download and install REFit. This will allow your BIOS to work with bootloaders other than that of Apple. Once you have installed it restart you machine. If you are lucky you will see the REFIt menu on restart. Do not be disappointed if you do not see it at first. Restart again and you will surely see the REFIt menu this time. Once you have REFIt installed it is time to partition the HardDisk to make room for Ubuntu.</p>

<ul>
<li>Partitioning the disk</li>
</ul>


<p>OSX comes with two utilities that allow you to partition your hard disk. Word of caution: Do not use another partitioning tool as it has been knows to cause problems - especially when booting back into the Mac. You will put your data on the Mac OSX partition at risk.
Given that you have to use OSX to atleast initially partitioning disks - you can choose between Disk Utility or Boot camp assistant. In both scenarios the partitioning is pretty clearly documented and easy. In the case of bootcamp with the new UI select &#8220;Install  or remove Windows 7&#8221; and uncheck &#8220;Download the latest Windows support from Apple&#8221;.</p>

<p>When prompted choose the partition size for Windows by dragging the partitioner. Once you have a desirable size configured clicking &#8216;Continue&#8217; will look for a Windows 7 disk for installing Windows on the new partition. You can trick the boot camp assistant by actually inserting a bootable Windows 7 disk. Once it detects the disk and starts partitioning you can remove the Windows 7 disk and replace it with Ubuntu bootable disk. Once the partitioning is complete close Bootcamp Assistant.</p>

<ul>
<li>Installing Ubuntu</li>
</ul>


<p>Now restart the machine and hold the &#8216;C&#8217; key while restarting. This will allow you to boot from the bootable CD Drive. Once booting starts you should see the Ubuntu installation UI. Follow the instructions till the time, when it asks you for a partition to install Ubuntu.
Choose manual partition editing.
At this moment it will show you a list of existing partitions. In this list find the partition you created for Windows(should be labelled as fat32 or msdos or something that indicates its a windows partition). Delete this partition. You should have a partition called &#8220;FREE SPACE&#8221;. Now select this partition called &#8220;FREE SPACE&#8221;(about the size of your original partition for Windows) and create a partition on it of type EXT4 and &#8220;/&#8221; being mounted from here.(Make note of this partition information eg: /dev/sda3)</p>

<p>Write this partition information to the disk and let Ubuntu do its thing. Follow the instructions on-screen to configure Ubuntu to your liking. Ubuntu will ask you where it should write the grub bootloader. At this prompt enter the above partition information /dev/sda3. This will ensure that REFIt will be able to find Ubuntu on your harddisk and allow you to boot into it. This step is the key to the process of being able to use the Ubuntu partition at all.</p>

<p>Once the installation of Ubuntu is completed shutdown your machine and restart. On restart you will see a REFIt menu with an option to select &#8216;Penguin operating system&#8217;. You may see multiple penguins. Pick the penguin that points to your harddisk partition above(/dev/sda3 => &#8216;Boot from Hard disk partition 3&#8217;) option and you can boot into Ubuntu.</p>

<p>With this both Ubuntu and Mac OSX can be booted into without much trouble. Infact on booting into linux Grub now detects Mac OSX as well.</p>

<p>Happy Dual booting&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p> I am in the process of moving the blog from my jekyll based site to <a href="http://github.com/octopress.git">octopress</a>. You will see that some of things work like:
You may notice :</p>

<ul>
<li>Posts show up clearer and nicer - because of octopress font selection</li>
<li>you will see my addition of tag cloud to octopress - so tags will show</li>
<li>archives - a list of archives arranged as an index page</li>
</ul>


<p>What does not yet work :</p>

<ul>
<li>Tags are not aligned on the page</li>
<li>Disqus comments are missing - thanks to discuss your comments are safe. They just need to be linked correctly</li>
<li>RSS feed is missing</li>
<li>My color scheme is missing - so does not reflect the author&#8217;s personality ;)</li>
</ul>


<p>Hope you will bear with me while I make things easier for me to post and bring a more pleasant reading experience for  you.</p>

<p>Thank you !!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have come across too many people who are either not willing to blog, or do not see the point. This blog post is for them.</p>
<p>(Recently, <a href="http://pagilista.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-become-blogger-in-5-steps.html">Elena Yatzeck</a> posted on this subject as well.)</p>
<p>I recently read a one-liner &#8220;I see I scorn, I do I regret, I blog to not forget&#8221;. (Usually I am turned off by one liners intending to pack everything including the reason for life in minimum words, but this one I like because it is funny enough.)</p>
<p>This above quote is enough motivation to keep me going on my blogging. In the day and age of #fb and #RT it is difficult to get people excited about the value of details and being able to express in elaboration. Blogs come to the rescue.</p>
<p>I experience this loss of details quite a bit. Recently on my <a href="http://charlespetzold.com/etc/DoesVisualStudioRotTheMind.html">M$ platform based assignment</a> I forgot to blog what we did to make our .<span class="caps">NET</span> application development painless. Now when I try to recollect some lessons I learnt I have to depend on my memory which is sloppy about details. I blog to ensure that I have less of these situations and that I can use my experience to my advantage &#8211; also maybe readers of my blog will benefit as well.</p>
<p>I would like to encourage more blogging so that I can benefit from your knowledge and learnings.</p>
<p>Here are a few reasons you should consider blogging:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Twitter is too short to explain anything in detail.</li>
	<li>Facebook will not understand when you say a lot without being emotional about it.</li>
	<li>Your long term memory is not that good &#8211; also it is not google searchable.</li>
	<li>All the short messages are easily lost in your tweetdeck. Google search will yield the desired message but will not provide you the context it appeared in.</li>
	<li>Blogs are on the web and searchable via google.</li>
	<li>Blogs can be as elaborate as you like &#8211; can be tagged, followed, copied and pasted from, tweeted about, and can turn into articles for publication.</li>
	<li>Blogs can also be collected and turned into books &#8211; for free.</li>
	<li>Self promotion &#8211; <a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2008/08/be-your-start-up.html">A good post by Jay Fields</a></li>
	<li>Blogs are permanent records(mostly) and they can be used to jog your own memory &#8211; or reminisce.</li>
</ol>
<p>How and where to blog?</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://xkcd.com/1043/">Tumblr</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> &#8211; beware of their weird copyright requirements.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.github.com">github</a> &#8211; <a href="http://github.com/octopress.git">octopress</a></li>
	<li>build your own blog engine and push it to <a href="http://www.heroku.com">heroku</a></li>
</ol>
<p>What are you waiting for? Go write something.</p></div>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Intended date of release 2012/02/13. Procrastination&#8230;. Finally released today.)</p>
<p>After upgrading to Ubuntu 11.10(Oneiric Oncelot) I had a unique problem with my machine that was not googleable. All I could see is a symptom where my <span class="caps">CPU</span> fans would start full speed and keep blowing for a while. While they were up all my CPUs would be at 100% utilization. On various occasions that this would happen I had to restart the machine as it became unresponsive. Often times this would happen at nights when the machine is not being used.</p>
<p>Recently when I was researching how to manage power settings with LUbuntu(which is harder than it sounds) I found that powernapd was something that Ubuntu running in background to manage power usage of the machine components. This sounds like a reasonable thing to run since Ubuntu now supports Netbooks, Notebooks and Desktops all at the same time. In my case since I am running Ubuntu on a desktop it did not need such strict power management. <br />
I decided to try and turn this daemon off. Now my <span class="caps">CPU</span> utilizations reflect the amount of processor power my currently running applications use and there is no fan whirring anymore.</p>
<p>ProTip: Tweak your Ubuntu &#8211; Lubuntu is minimalistic so use Ubuntu Gnome to tweak LUbuntu settings.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When preparing for a presentation recently I was looking at various presentation tools at my disposal.</p>
<p>Purchasing one of those mouse like remotes was an option. I already had a magic mouse that could do the job. I also had a mac remote with keys that indicated forward/reverse. But by default it cannot be used as a mouse like remote for forward/reverse.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.filewell.com/iRedLite/">iRedlite</a> . Just the tool I was looking for to use the slick mac remote for my presentation.</p>
<p>As an added bonus iRedlite is programmable to achieve different functionality based on the context of the application. Also that application context can be changed using the remote.</p>
<p>Thank you <a href="http://tinbert.com/">tin:b</a> for such applications. They have many more &#8211; check them out.</p></div>
