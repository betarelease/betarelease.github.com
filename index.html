  <div class="entry-content"><p> I am in the process of moving the blog from my jekyll based site to
octopress:&#8221;http://github.com/octopress.git&#8221;. You will see that some of
things work like:</p>

<h3>Posts show up clearer and nicer - because of octopress font selection</h3>

<h3>you will see my addition of tag cloud to octopress - so tags will show</h3>

<h3>archives - a list of archives arranged as an index page</h3>

<p>What does not yet work :</p>

<h3>Tags are not aligned on the page</h3>

<h3>Discuss comments are missing - thanks to discuss your comments are safe. They just need to be linked correctly</h3>

<h3>RSS feed is missing</h3>

<h3>My color scheme is missing - so does not reflect the author&#8217;s personality ;)</h3>

<p>Hope you will bear with me while I make things easier for me to post and
bring a more pleasant reading experience for  you.</p>

<p>Thank you !!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have come across too many people who are either not willing to blog, or do not see the point. This blog post is for them.</p>
<p>(Recently, <a href="http://pagilista.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-become-blogger-in-5-steps.html">Elena Yatzeck</a> posted on this subject as well.)</p>
<p>I recently read a one-liner &#8220;I see I scorn, I do I regret, I blog to not forget&#8221;. (Usually I am turned off by one liners intending to pack everything including the reason for life in minimum words, but this one I like because it is funny enough.)</p>
<p>This above quote is enough motivation to keep me going on my blogging. In the day and age of #fb and #RT it is difficult to get people excited about the value of details and being able to express in elaboration. Blogs come to the rescue.</p>
<p>I experience this loss of details quite a bit. Recently on my <a href="http://charlespetzold.com/etc/DoesVisualStudioRotTheMind.html">M$ platform based assignment</a> I forgot to blog what we did to make our .<span class="caps">NET</span> application development painless. Now when I try to recollect some lessons I learnt I have to depend on my memory which is sloppy about details. I blog to ensure that I have less of these situations and that I can use my experience to my advantage &#8211; also maybe readers of my blog will benefit as well.</p>
<p>I would like to encourage more blogging so that I can benefit from your knowledge and learnings.</p>
<p>Here are a few reasons you should consider blogging:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Twitter is too short to explain anything in detail.</li>
	<li>Facebook will not understand when you say a lot without being emotional about it.</li>
	<li>Your long term memory is not that good &#8211; also it is not google searchable.</li>
	<li>All the short messages are easily lost in your tweetdeck. Google search will yield the desired message but will not provide you the context it appeared in.</li>
	<li>Blogs are on the web and searchable via google.</li>
	<li>Blogs can be as elaborate as you like &#8211; can be tagged, followed, copied and pasted from, tweeted about, and can turn into articles for publication.</li>
	<li>Blogs can also be collected and turned into books &#8211; for free.</li>
	<li>Self promotion &#8211; <a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2008/08/be-your-start-up.html">A good post by Jay Fields</a></li>
	<li>Blogs are permanent records(mostly) and they can be used to jog your own memory &#8211; or reminisce.</li>
</ol>
<p>How and where to blog?</p>
<ol>
	<li>Wordpress</li>
	<li><a href="https://xkcd.com/1043/">Tumblr</a></li>
	<li>blogger &#8211; beware of their weird copyright requirements.</li>
	<li>github &#8211; octopress</li>
	<li>build your own blog engine and push it to heroku</li>
</ol>
<p>What are you waiting for? Go write something.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Intended date of release 2012/02/13. Procrastination&#8230;. Finally released today.)</p>
<p>After upgrading to Ubuntu 11.10(Oneiric Oncelot) I had a unique problem with my machine that was not googleable. All I could see is a symptom where my <span class="caps">CPU</span> fans would start full speed and keep blowing for a while. While they were up all my CPUs would be at 100% utilization. On various occasions that this would happen I had to restart the machine as it became unresponsive. Often times this would happen at nights when the machine is not being used.</p>
<p>Recently when I was researching how to manage power settings with LUbuntu(which is harder than it sounds) I found that powernapd was something that Ubuntu running in background to manage power usage of the machine components. This sounds like a reasonable thing to run since Ubuntu now supports Netbooks, Notebooks and Desktops all at the same time. In my case since I am running Ubuntu on a desktop it did not need such strict power management. <br />
I decided to try and turn this daemon off. Now my <span class="caps">CPU</span> utilizations reflect the amount of processor power my currently running applications use and there is no fan whirring anymore.</p>
<p>ProTip: Tweak your Ubuntu &#8211; Lubuntu is minimalistic so use Ubuntu Gnome to tweak LUbuntu settings.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When preparing for a presentation recently I was looking at various presentation tools at my disposal.</p>
<p>Purchasing one of those mouse like remotes was an option. I already had a magic mouse that could do the job. I also had a mac remote with keys that indicated forward/reverse. But by default it cannot be used as a mouse like remote for forward/reverse.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.filewell.com/iRedLite/">iRedlite</a> . Just the tool I was looking for to use the slick mac remote for my presentation.</p>
<p>As an added bonus iRedlite is programmable to achieve different functionality based on the context of the application. Also that application context can be changed using the remote.</p>
<p>Thank you <a href="http://tinbert.com/">tin:b</a> for such applications. They have many more &#8211; check them out.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the opportunity to speak at the <a href="http://agileandbeyond.org">Agile and Beyond</a> conference recently. I loved the crowd, excellent turnout of 650+ people mostly from the Detroit MI area. Everyone was enthusiastic about learning how Agile can change the way they do their daily jobs.</p>
<p>I had a chance to present my ideas on improving how you refactor builds to get better feedback and change the way you work. I was also excited because this time I did a complete powerpoint/keynote free <a href="http://betarelease.github.com/build_feedback/slides.html">presentation</a>. I used <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">deck.js</a> and the good markdown tweak called <a href="https://github.com/infews/keydown">keydown</a>. Need to make a few feature additions to keydown soon.(I said it first : A fun project would be make <a href="https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js">impress.js</a> markdown friendly, like keydown.)</p>
<p>Lots of great presentations &#8211; varying form lean, kanban to plain old agile. Excellent facility at the Ford Convention Center, also had some time to see Detroit and also <a href="http://www.thehenryford.org">The Henry Ford Museum</a>.</p>
<p>Overall a great experience. Thank you agile and beyond team.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bundler is a tool for managing installed libraries on a ruby project. It comes bundled with rails 3 but can be used standalone without rails. <br />
Bundler tries to fix issues with having to manage your gems(and their related dependencies and versions) in a clean way. In doing so it allows you to work on your application and not have to worry about dependencies sucking the life out of your releases.</p>
<p>Off late I have been working on an application that vendorizes its gems and packages them while shipping the application. Since this application is also been built in the traditional way(rails 2) I was looking to use bundler with it to do the vendorization. Turns out bundler supports such a use case.</p>
<p>For a packaged application bundler allows you to freeze the gems and unpack them in the <br />
location of your choosing. This path can then be added to your application to load all the <br />
frozen gems. The following command with the path set to the location you would like to unpack your gems allows you to use bundler to vendorize gems.</p>
<div>
<pre>
<code class='ruby'>bundle install --path vendor/bundle</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>You can then add these gems to your application as you would for vendorized gems.</p>
<h3>Bundler with rvm and gemsets</h3>
<p>One of the popular opinions is to just use bundler and ditch gemsets. I tend to use both gemsets and bundler to my advantage. This helps especially when I am working on multiple applications and when I am not online all the time. I ensure that my bundle is upto date before I go offline and then can work on my apps when I am offline by switching gemsets. Sometimes I tend to have multiple gemsets built when I am working on changing or experimenting with gems.</p>
<p>That way I do not have conflicts when I am using one version of rake for a ruby 1.8.7 application while my other ruby 1.9.3 application uses the latest and greatest rake gem.</p>
<h3>Cleaning your gems before using bundler</h3>
<p>Bundler allows you to install and update a set of gems based on the Gemfile. But it is not obvious how you would set up an application that has local gems installed to start using bundler. To start you need to delete all gems from the current gems. Having a clean workspace allows bundler to install gems from Gemfile without conflicts and can prevent a lot of confusion when multiple versions of a gem being installed side by side.</p>
<p>Here is a snippet that will allow you to clean your gemset.</p>
<div>
<pre>
<code class='ruby'>Delete all gems from gemset
gem list | cut -d &#8217; &#8217; -f1 | xargs gem uninstall -aIx</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>In most cases this will work. But rake seems to be installed as part of the global gemset. So the above command will delete all gems till rake and then abort. To skip deleting rake change the above script as follows</p>
<div>
<pre>
<code class='ruby'>gem list | cut -d ' ' -f1 | ack -v 'rake' | xargs gem uninstall -aIx</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>(ack is further reading if you don&#8217;t already know what it does.)</p></div>

<p>I found a wonderful tool written by Scott Chacon called <a href="https://github.com/schacon/grack.git">grack</a>. grack is a git server on top of rack. Its elegance is in its design.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had almost forgotten about <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-slideshow/">Tab Slideshow</a> for Firefox but an appropriate application of it jogged my memory. We wanted to show a few build reports on the dashboard and also wanted them to be big and visible. Also the reports do not change as rapidly as the build and can afford to be little delayed (since mostly we are showing long running build results). So we just opened up those reports in a tab each and started ‘Tab Slideshow’. Worked like a charm. We now have the simplest dashboard.</p>

<p>Note: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loepeenhjndiclafjgoackjblfhonogb">Tab Slideshow for Chrome</a> does not seem to refresh the tabs where as the Firefox version does what is expected.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have an airport express that I used to use as my wireless router when I travel. Very convenient and useful when hotels do not provide a wireless.(Yes I am looking at you Marriott.) Airport Express thanks to apple technology also supports airplay to play music over the air, and/or printer sharing via a USB connection.</p>

<p>I was hoping to connect my desktop and my laptop to my music system which is located in another room than these machines. Apparently airport express can connect with your existing wireless router as a client (yes they have thought of everything) allowing you to do exactly that.</p>

<p>Here is a list of quirks you need to remember when you try to set it up as a <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2272?viewlocale=en_US">wireless
client</a>.</p>

<p># Prerequisites - Note down the channel number your current wireless router is transmitting on - anywhere between 1~~11.</p>

<p># Plug in the airport express and connect it to your mac using the ethernet cable.</p>

<p># Start airport utility~~ which will try to detect any airport devices but will not find any.</p>

<p># Hard reset by pressing the reset button with a paper clip for atleast 10 seconds. The light blinks rapidly when you are holding the pin and then in 30 seconds becomes steady - this means that airport express is restarting.</p>

<p># Now rescan on the airport utility - it should find one device with name ‘Base station xxxxxx’ - with last 6 digits from the mac address. It should have a yellow icon next to it - indicating that it has not connected to the internet.</p>

<p># Perform a Manual Setup - DO NOT hit continue.</p>

<p># Change the channel number that is automatically set on the airport express to the one from your wireless router.</p>

<p># In ‘Wireless’ connect the airport express as a client - select ‘Join an existing wireless network’ - select appropriate SSID of the wireless router.</p>

<p># Browse through other tabs if you are interested in the details - else click ‘Update’.</p>

<p># The airport express should restart and reappear on the Airport Utility. This usually takes over a minute. When it reappears it should appear with the new name you chose and with a green light next to it - indicating it was able to connect to your wireless router.</p>

<p># If everything was successful and airport express liked the ‘Enable for Airplay’ selection you made - you will see a red light in the stereo socket light up. Connect your speakers to airport express and you should be able to airplay your music using iTunes.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p># You may encounter “AirPort Utility was unable to find your AirPort wireless device after restarting.” One of the reasons for this is that Airport express cannot connect to your router with WPA2 or any other security.(Look at <a href="http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/internet-networking-wireless/103890-airport-express-existing-wireless-network-help.html">Airport Express Amber Light</a> for more details.)</p>

<p># To ensure security I disabled ‘SSID broadcast’ and enabled MAC filtering on my router. I added the MAC addresses of my Airport Express (Airport Admin Utility will show those addresses when it detects Airport Express.)</p>

<p>To allow your linux machine to connect and airplay to the airport express you need install pulseaudio’s drivers and support for remote audio protocol by running <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/apples-airtunes-ubuntulinux/">airtunes with Linux</a></p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-module-raop paprefs

(I am not making this up- The protocol is Remote Audio Output Protocol - raop)</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>Setup pulseaudio to enable remote speakers as described in <a href="http://blog.paulbetts.org/index.php/2007/04/15/pulseaudio-in-ubuntu-feisty-play-sound-over-the-network/">PulseAudio settings</a>.</p>

<p>Once it is installed you may need to restart your Linux machine. On restarting you should see your newly available remote speakers in your Sound Preferences. Now you should be able to stream from your Linux machine too.</p>
