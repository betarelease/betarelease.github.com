I have moved my personal blog from blogspot to
[github pages][http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages].
[Dr. Nic][http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/12/21/migrating-project-websites-to-github-pages-with-sake-tasks-new-websites-with-jekyll_generator/"] and [Mojombo][http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master] helped me do it with Jekyll.
