The venue and the setting in which the training is conducted forms a
very important part of how the training is received. When selecting the
venue ensure a few things beforehand:

-   Venue is accessible - by suitable means of transportation - by walk
    would be the optimum
-   Venue has ample space - to be rearranged and suited for all kinds of
    training sessions.[\#seating]
-   Venue has a high ceiling and is mostly soundproof - this ensures
    that there is enough air circulation and privacy when the training
    is in session.
-   Consider custom lighting arrangement to be used during facilitation.
    Most of our sessions did run with full lighting as well as the
    projector running all the time. Activities during training do need
    sufficient lighting.
-   Venue has the facility to provide for the meals for the day -
    coffee/breakfast, lunch, high tea - which is why hotels with
    restaurant service are preferable. This can help cater to trainees
    with special food requirements.
-   Venue has ample electricity outlets to support the training crew as
    well as the trainees. We did carry some of our own extension cords
    to ensure availability of power near the trainee tables.
-   Venue has decent internet connectivity - Now I have seen and heard
    about venues that mostly suck at providing decent internet
    connectivity for anything over 10 users. If that is the case with
    your venue arrange for some way to get to the internet. Most
    importantly arrange for some way of sharing the computers over a
    network - this helps in distributing material, assignments,
    solutions. We arranged for our own wireless router which allowed to
    share the internet as well as create a private network. Not to
    mention we did have plenty of USB keys available for quick transfer
    of large files.
-   Ensure that the venue has a person to be the point of contact when
    the training is in session. This will help resolve last minute
    issues/hiccups. Treat this person with respect - when you do this
    you are sure to get better service.
-   Have the venue arrange for a projector on site. Alternatively also
    carry your own projector in case the projector at the venue dies or
    you need to project multiple things at the same time.
