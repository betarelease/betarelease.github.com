Released
<a href="http://github.com/betarelease/accordion.js/tree/master">accordion.js</a>
on github. We were quite frustrated with the way <a href="http://www.stickmanlabs.com/accordion/">accordion v2.0</a> behaved with prototype1.6. Upgrading that from prototype1.5 broke the accordion when using with images. Our simple version does not have anyeffects yet but work beautifully and is completely tested.

Try it out!
