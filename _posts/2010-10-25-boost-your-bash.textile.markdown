title: Boost your BASH - and never again work with a plain shell
tags: [bash, dotfiles, unix, shell, vcs, git, svn]
---

Over the past few months I have been using a community version of bash*profile, bash*login, emacs settings and such. It started when [Muness](http://github.com/muness) shared his bash\_vcs (which was pimped command prompt) and I was hooked. I noticed a few projects that were sharing similar shell settings and enhancements. Forking from [Tobyâ€™s dotfiles](http://github.com/ttripp/dotfiles) I started enhancing my experience on every machine I worked. This not only lead me to have a better understanding how different flavours of Unix work and also helped me automate a lot of my day to day activities.

Allow me to introduce [the dotfiles project](http://github.com/betarelease/dotfiles) which comes with all those enhancements - stolen and tweaked from many sources - and with valuable help from [Patrick Turley](http://github.com/pturley). Recent additions include bash\_boost and what could be called the beginnings of a javavm (inspired by rvm for ruby.) Now with more brainpower behind dotfiles we hope to add more features fast. Next steps include adding support for zsh.

Give it a try, fork it or point us to more stuff we can steal to improve it for you.
