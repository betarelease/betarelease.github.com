I had the opportunity to speak at the "Agile and Beyond":http://agileandbeyond.org conference recently. I loved the crowd, excellent turnout of 650+ people mostly from the Detroit MI area. Everyone was enthusiastic about learning how Agile can change the way they do their daily jobs.

I had a chance to present my ideas on improving how you refactor builds to get better feedback and change the way you work. I was also excited because this time I did a complete powerpoint/keynote free "presentation":http://betarelease.github.com/build_feedback/slides.html. I used "deck.js":http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/ and the good markdown tweak called "keydown":https://github.com/infews/keydown. Need to make a few feature additions to keydown soon.(I said it first : A fun project would be make "impress.js":https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js markdown friendly, like keydown.)


Lots of great presentations - varying form lean, kanban to plain old agile. Excellent facility at the Ford Convention Center, also had some time to see Detroit and also "The Henry Ford Museum":http://www.thehenryford.org.

Overall a great experience. Thank you agile and beyond team.
