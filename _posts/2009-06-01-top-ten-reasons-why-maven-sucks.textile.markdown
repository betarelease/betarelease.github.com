1. maven corrupts - software, people.

2. maven uses an archetype (appfuse) and expects that all your projects look like the apache projects - even those that are not webservers.

3. maven has only four build stages - compile, test, install, package - if you have a requirement to automate performance testing you are out of luck

4. maven requires you to have a standard directory structure that is 5 subdirectories deep - regardless of the fact that your project only has 10 java files.

5. tasks that are not implemented in maven have to be implemented in ant and need to be integrated with maven - a big nightmare.

6. maven encourages you to integrate via binaries - thus making continuous integration difficult

7. every time maven builds it connects to the internet (to verify/update dependencies) - building your project without the internet is extremely hard.

8. maven manages the projects and subprojects implicitly (since there is convention and then there are overrides) - it makes debugging your build impossible.

9. maven manages the project dependencies in its own repository - called the .m2 repository - which is not part of your application folder - thus making it impossible to track and package development environments.

10. maven always downloads the whole internet - to keep its dependencies up to date - even though you donâ€™t want to.
