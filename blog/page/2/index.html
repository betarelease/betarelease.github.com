  <div class="entry-content"><p>For development I choose to use tools which make the code transparent. Hence I prefer to use simple text editors over IDEs (although I like IntelliJ for Java code), or browsers that have good builtin support for debugging over closed/magical ones (hence Firefox/Chrome/Safari over IE).</p>

<p>Recently I switched to Chrome as my primary browser since it promised to have all the add-ons to make it comparable to Firefox. On the contrary, in fact it still lacks the power and the flexibility of Firefox for development. Here are a few reasons why Firefox is still better at supporting development:</p>

<p>* <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748/">greasemonkey</a> for Firefox works with XMLHTTPRequests for different origin -
<a href="http://greasemetal.31tools.com/">greasemetal</a> (now <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/user-scripts">userscripts</a>)
for Google Chrome has still not been able to fix this issue.</p>

<p>_“GM<em>xmlhttpRequest is same-origin only.&#8221; - <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/user-scripts">User Scripts</a>
.</em></p>

<p>* A number of add-ons on Firefox show useful information on the status bar - I use ”DCurrency“:<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6462/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6462/</a>, ”CruiseControl Monitor“:<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/896/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/896/</a>.</p>

<p>*”Selenium IDE&#8221;:<a href="http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide">http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide</a>/ is available for Firefox - a big plus when I am trying to record andplay while I am trying to debug some apps.</p>

<p>* In the minimal view my frequently used bookmarks always show in Firefox ~~Google Chrome shows them when I open a new tab only. Maybe a minor annoyance but I cannot reuse the current tab with a single click access to my bookmarks.</p>

<p>* Minor annoyance~~ when I maximize the window on OSX Google Chrome expands only vertically. Firefox does not have this problem.</p>

<p>* Even with proxy switchers Chrome depends/modifies system proxy settings (diabolical). When using on Windows changing the proxy on IE will affect Chrome and vice-versa.</p>

<p><em>“Chrome uses system’s proxy settings (IE proxy settings on Wndows) because it doesn’t have its own proxy settings yet (see <a href="http://crbug.com/266">http://crbug.com/266)</a>).Therefore, changing Chrome’s proxy settings using Switchy will also affect the system proxy settings.” - quote from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/caehdcpeofiiigpdhbabniblemipncjj">Proxy Switchy!</a> extension.</em></p>

<p>That means when I use Chrome as a browser with tools like <a href="http://sahi.co.in/w/">Sahi</a>, it will affect how other things work.</p>

<p>In conclusion, for now Firefox is the best browser for development.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few months I have been using a community version of bash<em>profile, bash</em>login, emacs settings and such. It started when <a href="http://github.com/muness">Muness</a> shared his bash_vcs (which was pimped command prompt) and I was hooked. I noticed a few projects that were sharing similar shell settings and enhancements. Forking from <a href="http://github.com/ttripp/dotfiles">Toby’s dotfiles</a> I started enhancing my experience on every machine I worked. This not only lead me to have a better understanding how different flavours of Unix work and also helped me automate a lot of my day to day activities.</p>

<p>Allow me to introduce <a href="http://github.com/betarelease/dotfiles">the dotfiles project</a> which comes with all those enhancements - stolen and tweaked from many sources - and with valuable help from <a href="http://github.com/pturley">Patrick Turley</a>. Recent additions include bash_boost and what could be called the beginnings of a javavm (inspired by rvm for ruby.) Now with more brainpower behind dotfiles we hope to add more features fast. Next steps include adding support for zsh.</p>

<p>Give it a try, fork it or point us to more stuff we can steal to improve it for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Returned from Ruby Kaigi last weekend. The conference was held in
Tsukuba International Convention Center and attended much of the
enthusiastic ruby community (including Matz, Chad Fowler, Charles
Nutter, Yehuda Katz et al). Had a blast presenting ‘Rocking the
Enterprise with Ruby’.</p>

<p>Of all the sessions I could attend I liked Matz keynote focusing on the
direction of Ruby 2.0. Especially the focus on mix-ins, issues with
module mixins and list of ancestors. Class-boxes also looked a very
interesting concept. Makes me want to use ruby 2.0 now. Based on the
timeline discussed it is on track to be released sometime in 2011.
(<a href="http://rubykaigi.tdiary.net/20100829.html#">Ruby 2.0</a>)</p>

<p>I also liked the treatment of metaprogramming handed out by
<a href="http://ducktypo.blogspot.com/">Paolo ‘Nusco’ Perrotta</a>. A
delightful presenter who can draw great illustrations as well as explain
the issues in ruby programming very well. His message ‘Look at source
code from projects to learn what they are doing’. Also, he concluded
that what works in Ruby works because of its design (metaprogramming,
mixins) may not work in Java/C#. So when you come to ruby you may have
to change the way you think.</p>

<p>Very enthusiastic response to lightning talks (in fact entries to
lightning talks were closed even before the start of the conference). \
Youngest ruby programmer (Shota Fukumori @sora_h) who wants to change
ruby internals with his gem ‘few’ and
<a href="http://github.com/benhoskings/babushka">babushka</a> by Ben
Hoskings were my
favourites.(<a href="http://rubykaigi.tdiary.net/20100831.html#p01">Lightning
Talks</a>)</p>

<p>The conference was organised very well, with an unofficial and official
party on Friday and Saturday. Thanks to everyone who worked to make this
a success.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over this weekend I set out to connect my Ubuntu machine with my Sony Bravia TV.( With inspiration from <a href="http://thoughtworker.in/2010/07/20/dns-323-ps3-and-upnp/">Sachin Dharmapurikar</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance">DLNA</a>.)</p>

<p>Googling yielded a number of techniques to stream media from linux over the home network. Some that did suit Bravia and some that did not. The
easiest one to work with was <a href="http://blog.mycila.com/2010/01/dlna-on-sony-bravia-tvs.html">minidlna server</a>. Snappy install and my Bravia recognised it like any other streaming website. I am running the minidlna server for my music and photos and all the content that is in DVD/mpeg2 format.(<a href="http://wiki.oppodigital.com/index.php?title=DLNA_Linux">How to install on linux</a>)</p>

<p>I do have some videos that came to me as avi and minidlna does not support transcoding. (There are some that describe how to do it with Windows but no out of the box solution with linux yet.) Google for <a href="http://ps3mediaserver.blogspot.com/">PS3 Media servers</a> I stumbled upon a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ps3mediaserver/">PS3 Media Server for Linux</a> - which is a java application that streams and transcodes nicely.</p>

<p>To get the video to be non-jittery and avoid ffmpeg/tsmuxer crashing I had to tone the transcoding down to Lowest Quality. Even with that the video is pleasing albeit a bit grainy in some cases. Documentation suggests allocating more memory or CPU might help.</p>

<p>To support all this I also installed a bunch of libraries described by many to help <a href="http://juliensimon.blogspot.com/2008/12/howto-compiling-mediatomb.html">transcode,mux and display thumbnails.</a>. The instructions are for mediatomb but these libraries work with other dlna servers.</p>

<p>Next stop Getting <a href="http://www.r3uk.com/index.php/home/38-software/122-ps3-dlna-streaming-in-ubuntu-gutsy">mediatomb to work on linux and bravia</a></p>

many on the web. \
I tried <a

sys#USB">Hardware Compatibility List for Linux</a> and many links on
that list. In an attempt to install custom drivers I would always end up
with a network card that would detect wireless but never would
communicate over wireless. After going through a number of cards and
uninstalling and installing drivers I found one that worked really well
without resorting to the ndiswrapper solution (dealing with anything
windows just feels unclean). Finally I found a card that worked and also
provided native linux drivers.The wireless usb card that worked was -

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the projects I worked on recently consisted of a number of
applications interacting with each other over REST. These applications
were written with an intention to obtain loose-coupling between them.</p>

<p>While writing more controller actions I noticed something that we were
doing repeatedly - anytime one particular model changed in the domain it
caused a ripple effect of making us change all the consumers in the
application suite. These models were all exposed across applications by
using ActiveResource. ActiveResource forced us to change every one of
the model/model manifestations in the application.</p>

<p>The main intent of the decoupling effort was to help us change these
applications almost independently of each other. These applications were
supposed to only depend on the exposed interfaces. What ActiveResource
did was forced us to tightly-couple them and a single change caused a
ripple effect.</p>

<p>So my question is ‘Is ActiveResource an oxymoron?’ - Especially
considering the fact that Active means really simple but strong
coupling. Active does apply nicely to a database record and eases
development by getting out of the way. But in case of lightly or ideally
decoupled applications does the Active make sense? - Probably not. So if
you want to expose objects and their behaviours over the wire maybe
ActiveResource is not such a good idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The venue and the setting in which the training is conducted forms a
very important part of how the training is received. When selecting the
venue ensure a few things beforehand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Venue is accessible - by suitable means of transportation - by walk
would be the optimum</li>
<li>Venue has ample space - to be rearranged and suited for all kinds of
training sessions.[#seating]</li>
<li>Venue has a high ceiling and is mostly soundproof - this ensures
that there is enough air circulation and privacy when the training
is in session.</li>
<li>Consider custom lighting arrangement to be used during facilitation.
Most of our sessions did run with full lighting as well as the
projector running all the time. Activities during training do need
sufficient lighting.</li>
<li>Venue has the facility to provide for the meals for the day -
coffee/breakfast, lunch, high tea - which is why hotels with
restaurant service are preferable. This can help cater to trainees
with special food requirements.</li>
<li>Venue has ample electricity outlets to support the training crew as
well as the trainees. We did carry some of our own extension cords
to ensure availability of power near the trainee tables.</li>
<li>Venue has decent internet connectivity - Now I have seen and heard
about venues that mostly suck at providing decent internet
connectivity for anything over 10 users. If that is the case with
your venue arrange for some way to get to the internet. Most
importantly arrange for some way of sharing the computers over a
network - this helps in distributing material, assignments,
solutions. We arranged for our own wireless router which allowed to
share the internet as well as create a private network. Not to
mention we did have plenty of USB keys available for quick transfer
of large files.</li>
<li>Ensure that the venue has a person to be the point of contact when
the training is in session. This will help resolve last minute
issues/hiccups. Treat this person with respect - when you do this
you are sure to get better service.</li>
<li><p>Have the venue arrange for a projector on site. Alternatively also
carry your own projector in case the projector at the venue dies or
you need to project multiple things at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>Transportation</p></li>
<li>Space</li>
<li>Food and drinks availability</li>
<li>Electric outlets and Wireless Internet/Shared network</li>
<li>Projectors</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Preparing to be a trainer is more of a mental activity than physical. To
be one you would want to observe one and learn how they do it. I had the
opportunity of being trained by a set of great trainers/speakers and
also working them to understand how they prepared to be a trainer.
Mostly it is about being aware of the responsibility. It takes time to
get a feel for the amount of work that goes into being a trainer. To
facilitate this we started by studying the course material that was
already available (In a sense I was lucky that there was so much refined
course material available that I did not need to invest any time in
design the course. Designing a course is a major undertaking and can be
done only after much experience [#feedback]).</p>

<p>Another thing you must do is actually be a co-trainer/teaching assistant
at a training session to get a feel of the mechanics of it all.(What
gets overlooked is the fact that managing time/schedule and training
content is harder than it appears.) To prepare to be such a person one
needs to know the complete training course. To be a developer trainer I
went through the exercise of reading all the material and also solving
and reasoning all the examples for the course. At times it also helps to
have multiple solutions at hand. In collaboration with other trainers
and trainees we have managed to have a repository of such sample
solutions that we are prepared with to hand out to trainees.</p>

<p>Once you have a grip on the course content you need to plan and replay
the plan of how the content will be presented. Pairing on course content
tremendously helps. In case of vast curriculum it helps to divide
responsibility between the pair to deliver certain topics based on
experience, enthusiasm and freshness of the trainer. Making a plan of
the day for every half hour slot helps get a feel of timeliness as well
as helps focus on delivering the most important message of the session
effectively. Rehearsing all this with a pair is greatly useful. We had
the opportunity to rehearse this training with the smaller group to time
ourselves as well as refine delivery of content. Understanding what
messages are to be delivering during the session and what content is to
be learnt after class/further exercise helps divide the content and
reduce course load.</p>

<p>There is a lot of physical activity involved too. To enhance retention
and recollection it may be a good idea to prepare homework/extra work
problems. Some students really gain a lot from working on these in their
spare time. A trick that also helps retention is ‘rinse and repeat’ - We
provided handouts of the most important messages of the session and
reviewed sessions at the end and few days later.</p>

<p>Preparing also needs to consider the amount of stationary required,
hardware required, accessories such as timers, props and power
availability at the venue.[#venue]</p>

<p>Training is a lot of hard work. Do not jump in if you don’t thing 12
hour days + dinner + a night out are not something you can take. Not to
mention activities that require you to be available on a weekend.</p>

<ol>
<li>Prepare course content</li>
<li>Plan out each day</li>
<li>Rehearse</li>
<li>Ensure retention by way of handouts or reviews</li>
<li>Prepare the venue to suit the training</li>
</ol>
