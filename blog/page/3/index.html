  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over this weekend I set out to connect my Ubuntu machine with my Sony Bravia TV.( With inspiration from <a href="http://thoughtworker.in/2010/07/20/dns-323-ps3-and-upnp/">Sachin Dharmapurikar</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance">DLNA</a>.)</p>

<p>Googling yielded a number of techniques to stream media from linux over the home network. Some that did suit Bravia and some that did not. The easiest one to work with was <a href="http://blog.mycila.com/2010/01/dlna-on-sony-bravia-tvs.html">minidlna server</a>. Snappy install and my Bravia recognised it like any other streaming website. I am running the minidlna server for my music and photos and all the content that is in DVD/mpeg2 format.(<a href="http://wiki.oppodigital.com/index.php?title=DLNA_Linux">How to install on linux</a>)</p>

<p>I do have some videos that came to me as avi and minidlna does not support transcoding. (There are some that describe how to do it with Windows but no out of the box solution with linux yet.) Google for <a href="http://ps3mediaserver.blogspot.com/">PS3 Media servers</a> I stumbled upon a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ps3mediaserver/">PS3 Media Server for Linux</a> - which is a java application that streams and transcodes nicely.</p>

<p>To get the video to be non-jittery and avoid ffmpeg/tsmuxer crashing I had to tone the transcoding down to Lowest Quality. Even with that the video is pleasing albeit a bit grainy in some cases. Documentation suggests allocating more memory or CPU might help.</p>

<p>To support all this I also installed a bunch of libraries described by many to help <a href="http://juliensimon.blogspot.com/2008/12/howto-compiling-mediatomb.html">transcode,mux and display thumbnails.</a>. The instructions are for mediatomb but these libraries work with other dlna servers.</p>

<p>Next stop Getting <a href="http://www.r3uk.com/index.php/home/38-software/122-ps3-dlna-streaming-in-ubuntu-gutsy">mediatomb to work on linux and bravia</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have faced the same problems with Wireless Networking as mentioned by
many on the web.</p>

<p>I tried <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsLinksys#USB">Hardware Compatibility List for Linux</a> and many links on that list. In an attempt to install custom drivers I would always end up with a network card that would detect wireless but never would communicate over wireless. After going through a number of cards and uninstalling and installing drivers I found one that worked really well without resorting to the ndiswrapper solution (dealing with anything windows just feels unclean). Finally I found a card that worked and also provided native linux drivers.The wireless usb card that worked was - <a href="http://sasha.gerrand.id.au/2010/06/03/resolving-driver-problems-for-d-link-dwa-125-wireless-150-usb-adapter-in-ubuntu/">D-Link DWA–125 with Ubuntu Lucid Lynx</a>.It also helped that D-Link in fact published a linux driver for their wireless usb card.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the projects I worked on recently consisted of a number of applications interacting with each other over REST. These applications were written with an intention to obtain loose-coupling between them.</p>

<p>While writing more controller actions I noticed something that we were doing repeatedly - anytime one particular model changed in the domain it caused a ripple effect of making us change all the consumers in the application suite. These models were all exposed across applications by using ActiveResource. ActiveResource forced us to change every one of the model/model manifestations in the application.</p>

<p>The main intent of the decoupling effort was to help us change these applications almost independently of each other. These applications were supposed to only depend on the exposed interfaces. What ActiveResource did was forced us to tightly-couple them and a single change caused a ripple effect.</p>

<p>So my question is ‘Is ActiveResource an oxymoron?’ - Especially considering the fact that Active means really simple but strong coupling. Active does apply nicely to a database record and eases development by getting out of the way. But in case of lightly or ideally decoupled applications does the Active make sense? - Probably not. So if you want to expose objects and their behaviours over the wire maybe ActiveResource is not such a good idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The venue and the setting in which the training is conducted forms a
very important part of how the training is received. When selecting the
venue ensure a few things beforehand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Venue is accessible - by suitable means of transportation - by walk
would be the optimum</li>
<li>Venue has ample space - to be rearranged and suited for all kinds of
training sessions.[#seating]</li>
<li>Venue has a high ceiling and is mostly soundproof - this ensures
that there is enough air circulation and privacy when the training
is in session.</li>
<li>Consider custom lighting arrangement to be used during facilitation.
Most of our sessions did run with full lighting as well as the
projector running all the time. Activities during training do need
sufficient lighting.</li>
<li>Venue has the facility to provide for the meals for the day -
coffee/breakfast, lunch, high tea - which is why hotels with
restaurant service are preferable. This can help cater to trainees
with special food requirements.</li>
<li>Venue has ample electricity outlets to support the training crew as
well as the trainees. We did carry some of our own extension cords
to ensure availability of power near the trainee tables.</li>
<li>Venue has decent internet connectivity - Now I have seen and heard
about venues that mostly suck at providing decent internet
connectivity for anything over 10 users. If that is the case with
your venue arrange for some way to get to the internet. Most
importantly arrange for some way of sharing the computers over a
network - this helps in distributing material, assignments,
solutions. We arranged for our own wireless router which allowed to
share the internet as well as create a private network. Not to
mention we did have plenty of USB keys available for quick transfer
of large files.</li>
<li>Ensure that the venue has a person to be the point of contact when
the training is in session. This will help resolve last minute
issues/hiccups. Treat this person with respect - when you do this
you are sure to get better service.</li>
<li><p>Have the venue arrange for a projector on site. Alternatively also
carry your own projector in case the projector at the venue dies or
you need to project multiple things at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>Transportation</p></li>
<li>Space</li>
<li>Food and drinks availability</li>
<li>Electric outlets and Wireless Internet/Shared network</li>
<li>Projectors</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Preparing to be a trainer is more of a mental activity than physical. To
be one you would want to observe one and learn how they do it. I had the
opportunity of being trained by a set of great trainers/speakers and
also working them to understand how they prepared to be a trainer.
Mostly it is about being aware of the responsibility. It takes time to
get a feel for the amount of work that goes into being a trainer. To
facilitate this we started by studying the course material that was
already available (In a sense I was lucky that there was so much refined
course material available that I did not need to invest any time in
design the course. Designing a course is a major undertaking and can be
done only after much experience [#feedback]).</p>

<p>Another thing you must do is actually be a co-trainer/teaching assistant
at a training session to get a feel of the mechanics of it all.(What
gets overlooked is the fact that managing time/schedule and training
content is harder than it appears.) To prepare to be such a person one
needs to know the complete training course. To be a developer trainer I
went through the exercise of reading all the material and also solving
and reasoning all the examples for the course. At times it also helps to
have multiple solutions at hand. In collaboration with other trainers
and trainees we have managed to have a repository of such sample
solutions that we are prepared with to hand out to trainees.</p>

<p>Once you have a grip on the course content you need to plan and replay
the plan of how the content will be presented. Pairing on course content
tremendously helps. In case of vast curriculum it helps to divide
responsibility between the pair to deliver certain topics based on
experience, enthusiasm and freshness of the trainer. Making a plan of
the day for every half hour slot helps get a feel of timeliness as well
as helps focus on delivering the most important message of the session
effectively. Rehearsing all this with a pair is greatly useful. We had
the opportunity to rehearse this training with the smaller group to time
ourselves as well as refine delivery of content. Understanding what
messages are to be delivering during the session and what content is to
be learnt after class/further exercise helps divide the content and
reduce course load.</p>

<p>There is a lot of physical activity involved too. To enhance retention
and recollection it may be a good idea to prepare homework/extra work
problems. Some students really gain a lot from working on these in their
spare time. A trick that also helps retention is ‘rinse and repeat’ - We
provided handouts of the most important messages of the session and
reviewed sessions at the end and few days later.</p>

<p>Preparing also needs to consider the amount of stationary required,
hardware required, accessories such as timers, props and power
availability at the venue.[#venue]</p>

<p>Training is a lot of hard work. Do not jump in if you don’t thing 12
hour days + dinner + a night out are not something you can take. Not to
mention activities that require you to be available on a weekend.</p>

<ol>
<li>Prepare course content</li>
<li>Plan out each day</li>
<li>Rehearse</li>
<li>Ensure retention by way of handouts or reviews</li>
<li>Prepare the venue to suit the training</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While working on my mac and trying to use giternal I ran into ‘no such file to load —rubygems’. While I had been using ruby apps on the machine for a while, without any issues and with all the installed gems, this seemed weird.</p>

<p>I tried using the irb and check if</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='mysql'>irb\&gt; require ‘rubygems’</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>would work. But I got the same error. I was using the default mac version of the ruby installation that is installed at ‘/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework…..’ and did verify that rubygems was installed and that rubygems.rb was also present.</p>

<p>On further investigation I found that the default ruby that was run on the command line was 1.8.7 when I expected 1.8.6.</p>

<p>It appears that my path contained ‘/opt/local/bin’ before ‘/usr/bin’ which made the 1.8.7 version of ruby default and thus clobbered all by 1.8.6 settings and lost rubygems.</p>

<p>To fix this I moved ‘opt/local/bin’ to be after ‘/usr/bin’ in my $PATH and voila everything works again.</p>

<p>I have also been meaning to try RVM - maybe its time to give it a shot since my personal projects are on 1.8.7 and I have jruby as well as 1.8.6 installed on my mac.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When trying to use <a href="http://github.com/betarelease/cc_monitor">cc_monitor</a> on my current project I hit the known snag of making it work with cruisecontrol.rb. For the umpteenth time I was not able to find any documentation on making it publish cc_tray compatible xml, which would make cc_monitor work with cc.rb.</p>

<p>After some googling and mucking around I downloaded latest cruisecontrol.rb and looked at its routes. I found a route “XmlServerReport.aspx” which does publish in ‘cctray’ format. I plugged it in to cc_monitor and it works like a charm.</p>

<p>So now I can announce that cc<em>monitor works with any java/ruby versions of cruisecontrol. If you would like to use cc</em>monitor with a continuous integration tool make sure it publishes a cc_tray compatible xml and you are all set.</p>

<p>Recently I successfully added ‘bacon’ to test my ramaze code for cc_monitor. The repository has been updated so check it out.</p>

<p>I was also suggested to check out <a href="http://github.com/betarelease/cc_board">cc_board</a> which is a build monitor written in sinatra by David Vollbracht. Another app to make big visible charts for your team!</p>

<p>The instructions that worked for me are as follows</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove all installations of flash (9, 10.. )</li>
<li>Remove all installations of gnash</li>
<li>Remove all installations of swfdec</li>
<li>(Basically remove everything that conflicts with flash player - some of these things come bundled with Ubuntu)</li>
<li><p>Remove any file in “/usr/lib/firefox/plugins” with the word flash in its name.
eg. libflashplayer.so or in my case alternate-flashplugin.so.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have verified that all this has gone (You could use about:plugins url in your firefox to see all the plugins you have along with their associated file types) - reinstall the latest version of flash player from adobe website.</p></li>
<li><p>You should have Hulu.com working.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Hope this helps someone who is trying to do the same.</p>

<p>“Now when someone asks - Do you have Flash working on Linux - you know what to say”</p>
